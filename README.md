# TAC-tic-toe

TAC-tic-toe is a noughts and crosses game.  The players are the computer operator and the computer itself. The operator (you!) win by placing three of your moves in a line within the grid. These may be in a horizontal, vertical or diagnal line. Players take turns placing their marks. You make either offensive moves to complete your line, or defensive, to block a line built by the computer.

## Introduction 

The game was created to test out offline development mechanisms for the Marconi TAC.
